#### emergency-cases-weather-pipeline

**Goal**

The goal of this project is to build a robust data pipeline that extracts, transforms, and loads (ETL) healthcare and weather data into a centralized database optimized for OLAP queries. This enables efficient analysis of the relationship between weather patterns and healthcare demands in Singapore.

Through this project, we aim to:

1.Extract Data from different sources though an ETL/ELT pipeline to a database.
2. Develop a well-structured database schema to support scalable and reliable analysis.
3. Assess whether rainfall influences emergency room admissions.
4. Evaluate the reliability of weather forecasts for planning hospital resources.
